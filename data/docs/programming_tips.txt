Programming Best Practices

Clean Code Principles:
1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Write small, focused functions
3. Add comments for complex logic
4. Follow consistent formatting
5. Handle errors gracefully

Version Control:
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use branching for features
- Review code before merging
- Keep commits atomic and focused

Testing:
- Write unit tests for functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use test-driven development when appropriate
- Maintain good test coverage

Performance:
- Profile code to find bottlenecks
- Use appropriate data structures
- Optimize algorithms before micro-optimizations
- Cache expensive computations when possible

Security:
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow principle of least privilege
