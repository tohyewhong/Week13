RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines retrieval with generation for better accuracy.

This document explains how RAG systems work:

1. Retrieval: The system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents
2. Augmentation: The retrieved documents are combined with the user's question
3. Generation: A language model generates an answer based on both the question and retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- More accurate answers by using external knowledge
- Reduces hallucinations in AI responses
- Allows for up-to-date information without retraining
- Provides source citations for transparency

Common applications include question-answering systems, chatbots, and research assistants.
